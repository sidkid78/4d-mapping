# Advanced AI Engine for Complex Query Processing with Explainability

This module implements a sophisticated AI engine that processes complex queries using:

- **Multiple specialized AI personas** for domain expertise  
- **Comprehensive explanation trees** for transparency  
- **Knowledge graph integration**  
- **Multi-step validation and verification**  
- **Weighted multi-persona analysis and consensus building**  
- **Visualization and response formatting** based on user expertise  

## Key Components

- **ExplanationNode**: Dataclass for building hierarchical explanation trees  
- **ReasoningType**: Enum defining different reasoning approaches  
- **AdvancedAIEngine**: Main engine class implementing the advanced query processing  
- **PersonaManager**: Manages specialized AI personas and scoring  
- **ConsensusBuilder**: Combines and weighs multi-persona analysis results  
- **ResponseFormatter**: Formats responses based on user expertise level  
- **VisualizationEngine**: Generates visualizations of analysis results  

## High-Level Steps

1. **Query parsing and decomposition**  
2. **Persona selection and activation**  
3. **Multi-persona parallel analysis**  
4. **Cross-validation and consensus building**  
5. **Explainable response generation**  
6. **Response formatting and visualization**  

## Example Usage

```python
engine = AdvancedAIEngine(config)
result = await engine.process_advanced_query(
    query="Complex regulatory analysis request",
    user_context={"expertise_level": "expert"}
)
